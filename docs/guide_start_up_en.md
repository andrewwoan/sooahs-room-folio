# Detailed Guide to Initializing a Digital Project

**Addressed to Young Individuals from CÃºcuta, Norte de Santander**

Greetings, talented youth of our land! This guide aims to explain, clearly and structurally, how to take the first steps in your digital projects.

## Identification and Function of Key Files

1.  **`package.json`: The Central Configuration File**
    * This file, in JSON format, is fundamental to your project. It contains vital information such as the project name, version, and, crucially, the **dependencies**.
    * Dependencies are external software libraries or tools that your project needs to function. They are listed here along with their compatible versions.
    * It also defines **scripts**, which are predefined commands to automate tasks like starting the development server, building the project, and running tests.

2.  **`package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`): The Installed Dependencies Registry**
    * This file is automatically generated when you install or update dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.
    * Its primary goal is to ensure **development environment consistency**, recording the exact versions of each installed dependency (including those of your dependencies). This prevents issues when working on different computers.
    * Direct editing of this file is not recommended; `npm` or `yarn` manages it.

3.  **`vite.config.js`: Vite-Specific Configuration (If Used)**
    * If your project uses **Vite**, a fast tool for building web interfaces, this file is important.
    * Here, you configure Vite's options: how the development server works (port, proxies), how the final project is built (optimization, where to save files), the Vite plugins used, and the configuration for CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.
    * It is only necessary if your project uses Vite.

## Steps to Launch Your Project

1.  **Accessing the Command Line:**
    * Open the **terminal** or **command prompt** on your computer.
    * Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the root folder of your project.

2.  **Installing Dependencies:**
    * Run the following command to download and install the necessary tools listed in `package.json`:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * If you use `yarn`, the command is:
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```
    * This will create a folder named `node_modules` where the dependencies will be saved.

3.  **Exploring Predefined Commands (`scripts`):**
    * Open the `package.json` file with a text editor.
    * Look for the `"scripts"` section. Here, you will see commands with names like `dev`, `start`, or `build`.

4.  **Executing the Development Start Command:**
    * To start the development server (to see your project as you work), run the corresponding command:
        * With `npm`:
            ```bash
            npm run <script-name>
            ```
            Example: `npm run dev`
        * With `yarn`:
            ```bash
            yarn <script-name>
            ```
            Example: `yarn dev`

5.  **Viewing the Application in the Browser:**
    * After running the start command, the terminal will display a local web address.
    * Copy this address (examples: `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173` if using Vite) and paste it into your web browser to see your project.

## Considerations for Vite Projects

If your project uses Vite, the process of installing dependencies and running the development server (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) remains the same. Vite facilitates a fast and efficient development environment.

By following these steps, you will be able to initialize your digital projects in an organized manner. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your creations!
